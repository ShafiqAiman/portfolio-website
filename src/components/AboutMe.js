            <p>I am currently a third-year of Computer Science Degree student at UNIMY who hopes to secure a Software Engineer position 
                by the end of this year. I am very passionate about technologies and how they can impact our world nowadays and in the 
                future. At UNIMY, I have learned a lot of programming languages to be implemented in the development like Python, Java, C, 
                C#, HMTL, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and many more. I also managed to learn programming skills that can enhance my programming 
                like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structure, and many more. 
                So far, I am involved in 2 Web Development and 3 Mobile App Development projects.
            </p>
            <p>I am also very passionate to lead people democratically with creative strategies. I am currently the Team Leader of 
                Roomah, a startup that was awarded by iCUBE International as First Runner-Up of CIPTA 2021 that I co-founded with some 
                of my friends. I was also the Team Leader in several projects that participated in International IT competitions like 
                Dell Hack2Hire 2021, and the International Innovation, Invention & Design (INDES) 2018. Besides, I was the President of 
                Student Committee 2020, President and Vice President (Student Activities & Events) of UNIMY Student Representative Council 
                2018/2019. I was also given the trust to be the Program Director in several events that involve UNIMY students, academicians, 
                and staff.</p>
